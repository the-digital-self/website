The Church of the Digital Self centers around the belief that our online or digital self is the same as our physical self. Our physical lives are increasingly being defined, controlled, and impacted by our ever growing online life, revealing that our physical and digital self are one and the same.

We can't escape being online today, and the Church of the Digital Self exists to remind us to regularly get offline, read a book, create some art, and spend time with our families and communities. We all need help grounding and centering ourselves in an increasingly digital world, and a healthy digital self means your physical self is healthy too.
