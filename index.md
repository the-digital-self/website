What I write online is me, and reflects who I am each day of my life.

<hr>

Photos of me online are me, and represent of piece of who I am each day.

<hr>

Videos of me online are me, and tell a story of who I am each day.

<hr>

My location is me, and is not alway something I am willing to share.

<hr>

Where I am going is mine, and I

Where I can from

What I watch

What I read

What I listen to

What I purchase

Events I attend

Where I default

Where I stay

My relationships
