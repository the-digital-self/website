        <p>I thought this post would end up being lengthy and difficult to write, but honestly I’ve been working on my relationships with Facebook for some time now. I had cleaned up my profile a while back. Deleting all of my posts, comments, and other activity prior to 2017. Since then I haven’t used the site much. Before that I used it a lot. I can’t 100% ditch Facebook because there are some people on there I care about and will most likely never see again, or know how to get a hold of them without Facebook. However, I’ve reached a point with the platform that I will only look in there once or twice a day at the most, sometimes going days without looking in there at all, and I never ever use on my mobile devices—-I only use the web browser to peak in from time to time, and post infrequently.</p>

        <p>Continuing my evaluation of the technology I let into my life, I’ve switched from Google to DuckDuckGo as my primary search engine. After switching browsers, and ditching Google Chrome for Firefox, I wanted to also put over a decade of Google usage for web search behind me. I know my individual protest on the use of Google as a search engine will not make much of a dent in their bottom line, but it still matters to me. The less data exhaust I give to Google, the better. The less my life is used to train Google algorithms the better. I’ve been off Google Search for almost two weeks now, and I much prefer DuckDuckGo as my source of information.</p>

        <p>I’ve been on Gmail since the early days. It’s been my primary email account for about 15 years. Today, I am demoting it. I recently ditched Google Chrome as my browser, and now I want to reduce my footprint when it comes to their email services. I have three primary emails, kinlane@gmail.com, info@apievangelist.com, and info@kinlane.com (go ahead and spam me, doesn’t bother me—I won’t read it). I ran the kinlane.com domain on Google Apps, but apievangelist.com I ran on some company in Sweden. I am consolidating both of them with my domain registrar Hover, and using kinlane.com as my primary domain. I”ll be doing business on apievangelist.com, but will be only receiving email on kinlane@gmail.com. After a while, I’ll just stop using Gmail altogether.</p>

        <p>After almost four weeks worth of work I finally managed to download all of my photos from a variety of services, and backup storage designations, de-duplicated them, and uploaded all of them to a single service–iPhoto. I went through Flickr, Instagram, Facebook, Dropbox, Google, Amazon, Apple, as well as some local file stores and aggregated all of my photos into a single place. I had to do it in waves on my laptop, because I have so many photos, it all didn’t fit on my hard drive. Eventually I was able to get them all onto my local hard drive after about twenty separate de-duplication jobs. Once done, I still couldn’t get them imported into iPhotos without moving to an external drive and importing in several batches from there.</p>

The gateway drug for the browser was definitely the search engine, email, and docs, but it was also the performance, and cult-like mentality of everything that was “Google Free” at the moment. Over a decade later, I just can’t stomach being so hooked into the Google ecosystem, with their surveillance business model, forcing me to further abandon as much of their tooling as I possibly can.</p>

        <p>Over the course of my life, I have had many highs and lows. Times where I feel organized and put together, with other moments where I feel scattered and stretched too thin. I’m pretty good at identifying the ups and downs of my world, but in the last decade I’ve noticed a new version of this creeping into my life. I have noticed with the increase in the number of Internet connected devices that I use, and the number of online accounts I possess, I am also experiencing a new form of being scattered and stretched too thin. Something that goes beyond just my job, career, kids, and the usual suspects that contribute to how I feel on a regular basis. In the last couple of years I’ve narrowed the causes of this feeling to be linked to my relationship with the online world–the web.</p>

        <p>Hello World is a favorite way to begin any learning experience in a computational world, so it seems like a fitting place to begin this journey. Hello World! For me, the world I am saying hello to is just a looking glass, where my physical self is saying hello my digital self, connecting the old me, with the new me. Over the last decade I have noticed an increasing level of impact on my physical well being originating from this new online, digital version of myself that has been evolving over the last 20 years–something which is occasionally defined by me, but more often that not, it is something that is being defined and directed by others. In 2019, I am finally tending to a burning need to understand this new version of my digital self that has emerged, working better define who I am, and what the impact the virtual world is actually inflicting on my physical well-being.</p>
