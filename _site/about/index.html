      <h1>About</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">We are told that technology is serving us, when it reality we are serving technology. Technology companies are constantly monitoring and surveilling us to generate more revenue, and sell access to our information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Digital Self is about identifying that who we are and what we do online is just as important as who we are and what we do offline, prioritizing not just self awarness, but also realizing we need more digital self awareness.
<p style="text-align: left;">The Digital Self is about ongoing affirmations that our data isn't for sale to the highest bidder because our data is us, and as human beings we cannot be bought and sold, regularly reminding us that we matter.</p>
